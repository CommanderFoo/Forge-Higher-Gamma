# Forge-Higher-Gamma

This is a Minecraft mod for Forge that allows you to toggle your gamma (default key "G").  

This option can be changed in the options.txt file in your Minecraft folder, but it requires a client restart because once you change your brightness in the UI, it caps out at 1.  This is a pain, and I didn't want to use LiteLoader, so I decided I would write my own so I can change the gamma on the fly when building without a restart.
