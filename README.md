# Forge-Higher-Gamma

This is a Minecraft mod for Forge that allows you to toggle your gamma (default key "G").  This option can be changed in the options.txt file in your Minecraft folder, but it requires a client restart.  I couldn't find a mod for Forge, only LiteLoader.

Gamma caps out at 1 by default, this mod will set the gamma much higher so you can see in the dark.  It's a toggle, so you can switch back to look at your pretty builds without needing to restart your client after editing the options file.
